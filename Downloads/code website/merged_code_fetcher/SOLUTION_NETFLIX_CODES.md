# üéØ SOLUTION: Netflix Codes Not Showing Up

## üîç Problem Identified

Your Outlook email account `wanterspirit826@outlook.com` is configured in the admin panel but has **"Never"** been used successfully. This indicates an **authentication problem**.

## üö® Root Cause: Outlook App Password Required

**Microsoft Outlook/Hotmail requires App Passwords for IMAP access, not regular passwords.**

## ‚úÖ SOLUTION STEPS

### Step 1: Generate Outlook App Password

1. **Go to Microsoft Account Security:**
   - Visit: https://account.microsoft.com/security

2. **Enable 2-Factor Authentication** (if not already enabled):
   - Click "Advanced security options"
   - Set up 2-step verification

3. **Create App Password:**
   - Click "Advanced security options"
   - Click "Create a new app password"
   - Choose "Mail" as the app type
   - **Copy the 16-character password** (example: `abcd efgh ijkl mnop`)
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT**: This is NOT your regular Microsoft password!

### Step 2: Update Email Account in Admin Panel

1. **Login to Admin Panel:**
   - Go to: http://localhost:5000/admin/login
   - Username: `admin`
   - Password: `admin123`

2. **Go to Email Accounts:**
   - Click "Email Accounts" in the sidebar

3. **Update the Outlook Account:**
   - Find `wanterspirit826@outlook.com`
   - Click the edit/update button
   - **Replace the password field with the App Password**
   - Save changes

### Step 3: Test the Connection

Run this command to test the connection:

```bash
cd merged_code_fetcher
python test_outlook_connection.py
```

This will tell you if the authentication is now working.

### Step 4: Test Netflix Code Fetching

1. **Make sure you have recent Netflix emails:**
   - Check your `wanterspirit826@outlook.com` inbox
   - Look for emails from Netflix with 4-digit verification codes
   - Check spam/junk folder too

2. **Test the Netflix page:**
   - Go to: http://localhost:5000/netflix
   - Enter a valid API key
   - Click "Get Netflix Code"

## üîß Alternative Solutions

### If App Password Doesn't Work:

1. **Check IMAP Settings:**
   - Ensure IMAP is enabled in Outlook settings
   - Go to Outlook.com ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Mail ‚Üí Sync email

2. **Try Different Email Provider:**
   - Gmail (also requires App Password)
   - Hostinger mail
   - Other IMAP-enabled providers

3. **Check Email Content:**
   - Netflix emails must contain 4-digit codes
   - Emails must be from netflix.com domains
   - Emails should be recent (within last few days)

## üéØ Quick Test Commands

### Test Email Account Connection:
```bash
cd merged_code_fetcher
python test_outlook_connection.py
```

### Test Netflix Code Fetching:
```bash
cd merged_code_fetcher
python test_email_fix.py
```

### Manual Netflix Code Test:
```bash
cd merged_code_fetcher
python -c "
from flask import Flask
from database import db, init_db
from email_reader import get_latest_netflix_code
app = Flask(__name__)
app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = 'sqlite:///instance/code_fetcher.db'
app.config['SQLALCHEMY_TRACK_MODIFICATIONS'] = False
init_db(app)
with app.app_context():
    result = get_latest_netflix_code()
    print('Netflix code result:', result)
"
```

## üìã Troubleshooting Checklist

- [ ] App Password generated from Microsoft Account
- [ ] Email account updated with App Password (not regular password)
- [ ] IMAP enabled in Outlook settings
- [ ] Recent Netflix emails exist in the account
- [ ] Netflix emails contain 4-digit verification codes
- [ ] Flask application is running without errors
- [ ] API key is valid and has remaining uses

## üéâ Expected Results

After fixing the App Password:

1. **Connection Test**: Should show "‚úÖ Login successful!"
2. **Netflix Code Fetching**: Should return a 4-digit code or "No recent codes found"
3. **Admin Panel**: Email account should show "Last Used: [recent timestamp]"

## üÜò Still Not Working?

If you're still having issues after trying the App Password:

1. **Check the Flask application console** for detailed error messages
2. **Verify you have recent Netflix verification emails**
3. **Try with a different email provider** (Gmail with App Password)
4. **Check firewall/antivirus** isn't blocking IMAP connections

**The most common issue is using a regular password instead of an App Password for Outlook. This should resolve your "no netflix code found" problem.**
